Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

We examined our program on inputs of varied sizes in the range of (10-300) and found out that time complexity is in O(n*logn).

The individual analysis of key functions used in the program is given below:

•	def registerPatient(self, name, age) - This function is performing two major operations:

    	When the program is executed for the first time and the patient details are loaded from an input file "inputPS6a.txt" we perform two operations:
        1.	Build a max heap using upheap approach – O(n)
        2.	Refreshing the queue based on age – O(n*logn)

    	When a newPatient tag is encountered in the input file "inputPS6b.txt, we perform three operations:
        1.	Adding patient to priority queue – O(1)
        2.	Build a max heap using upheap approach – O(n)
        3.	Refreshing the queue based on age – O(n*logn)

•	def enqueuePatient(self, PatId) - This function adds new patient to the max heap. This function is called every time a new patient is added. It performs two operations:
        1.	Assigning the patient a place in max heap – O(1)
        2.	Refreshed the queue to keep it updated – O(n*logn)

•	def nextPatient(self) - This function is called whenever program encounters “nextPatient” tag in “inputPS6b.txt” file.
                            It fetches the highest priority patient from the priority queue which is always present at the root of the max heap.
                            It performs two operations:
        1.	Calls the dequeue function to get the highest priority patient – O(1)
        2.	Writes the dequeued patient to the output screen – O(1)

•	def _dequeuePatient(self, PatId) - This functions removes the patient from the heap and updates the queue. It performs two operations:
        1.	Removes the patient id from the queue – O(1)
        2.	Refreshes the queue – O(logn)

The total time complexity of all the operations combined comes to O(n*logn) in the worst case also indicated the by

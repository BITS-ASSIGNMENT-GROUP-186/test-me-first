# test-me-first
Welcome to the best patient appointment scheduling software out in the market.

The project has three modules. Brief description of each module is given below:

1) main.py - Entry point the program. Calls the method in patient utils class to register the patients, arrange them in a queue and output the results.

2) data_structure.py - Contains custom data structure to hold the patient records (doubly linked list) and Testing Queue(max heap) to prioritize the patients.

3) utils.py - Contains the patients_utils class which encompasses all the basic functions from registering the patients 
              to dequeue-ing the patients from the heap, after assigning them the correct priority.

We are using two input files present in the folder /input
- inputPS6a.txt - Contains initial set of patients
- inputPS6b.txt - Contains next batch of patients

Results/Validation errors/Exceptions will be outputted to 'outputPS6.txt' present in the folder /output
